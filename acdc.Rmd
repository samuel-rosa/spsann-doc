The objective function **ACDC** was designed to optimize sample patterns for 
spatial trend estimation for soil mapping using statistical models, also known
as pedometric or digital soil mapping (DSM). The concept behind **ACDC** comes 
from the method originally proposed by MinasnyEtAl2006b (M&M henceforth), which
they called the *conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling*. This is the most
commonly used sampling method for spatial trend estimation for DSM nowadays.

The general idea of the method of M&M is to reproduce in the sample the marginal
distribution of the numeric covariates and class proportion of factor 
covariates. The main assumption for this is that the *true* spatial trend model
is more likely to be identified if the sample reproduces the marginal 
distribution/class proportion of the covariates. Taking each covariate 
individually, **ACDC** corresponds to the *equal-area* or *quantile* sampling
method (WebsterEtAl2013).

The main free and open source implementation of the method of M&M is the 
R-package ***clhs*** by RoudierEtAl2012. The package extended the method of M&M
including the possibility to consider a cost surface that penalizes sampling
locations that are difficult to access. Other researchers have also implemented
the method of M&M as to consider a cost function (MulderEtAl2013; 
CliffordEtAl2014), but none is available as a free software package. The 
current version of the R-package ***spsann*** does not consider operational
constraints.

Built on top of the experience gained since the publication of the method of 
M&M in 2006, ***spsann*** tries to go a step further in the knowledge on
sampling for trend estimation. The implementation of the objective function 
**ACDC** as `optimACDC()` includes new features without excluding the basic 
ideas and strength of the method of M&M. We describe bellow these features, 
pointing to the weak and strong points of our software implementation. We end 
presenting the equations used to define our objective function.

# Covariates

Five types of covariates, also known as predictor variables, can be used to
calibrate a spatial trend model for DSM. Let us see their definition 
(Everitt2006):

* Binary: covariates which occur in one of two possible states (true/false,
yes/no), these often being labelled 0 and 1. Example: presence/absence of rock
outcrops, change/no change in land use, and deep/shallow soil.

* Continuous: covariates not restricted to particular values except in so
far as this is constrained by the accuracy of the measuring instrument. 
Example: slope, NDVI, and clay content.

* Categorical: covariates that give the appropriate label of an observation
after allocation to one of several possible categories. Example: soil taxa, 
land use type, and geological formation.

* Discrete: covariates having only integer values. Example: number of soil
horizons, number of tillage operations, and number years after burning.

* Ordinal: covariates composed by a measurement that allows the individuals to
be ranked with respect to some characteristic but where differences at different
points of the scale are not necessarily equivalent. Example: drainage status
(poor, moderate, well), profile development (shallow, moderately developed,
deep), and pollution risk (low, moderate, high).

When we calibrate a spatial trend model in R, we have to be aware that R has
different definitions for the variables. Continuous and discrete variables are
defined as numeric and integer variables, respectively. Binary, categorical and
ordinal covariates are defined as factor variables. The current version of
`optimACDC()` handles numeric, integer, and factor covariates. For convenience
we group the first two and call them *numeric* covariates, and maintain the 
term *factor* for factor covariates.

It is important to bear in mind that, because we are working in the spatial
setting, the covariates have two important features that make them quite
different from those covariates used in the traditional statistical setting. 
These features dictate how they should be handled.

The first important feature is that each covariate is spatially exhaustive, that 
is, they cover the entire spatial domain. The set of values of a covariate
composes the population of values of that covariate. As such, when calculating
any statistic to describe the population, we should use the appropriate equation
for population estimates. This also means that the population of covariate
values is constrained not only by the feature space, but also by the geographic
space -- the limits of the spatial domain. It results that not all 
mathematically possible values exist, and we are constrained to the population
of existing values. This is why the method of M&M is called *constrained* Latin
hypercube sampling.

The second important feature is that the covariates are not random uncertain
variables (with a few exception). Instead, in DSM we assume that they have been
measured without error, and attribute to them a deterministic effect on the soil
property being modelled. The direct consequence is that we cannot make any
statistical inference about the covariates because the methods of statistical
inference are devised for random variables. A histogram of frequency, a
correlation matrix, or and an estimate of the quantiles have only a descriptive
value.

The adjective *constrained* is an important information about the method of M&M.
However, the original Latin hypercube sampling method was devised to work with
random variables for simulations in computer experiments (McKayEtAl1979;
ImanEtAl1982). The nature of the variables is different from that of those
employed in DSM. For example, there the variables are characterized by a
probability distribution function (PDF) or by a multivariate PDF such as a
Gaussian random field (PebesmaEtAl1999). This shows that, although conceptually
similar, the two methods are rather different. These differences have not been
fully taken into account so far. We demonstrate bellow some of the undesirable
consequences and how we solve it in the current implementation of `optimACDC()`.

## Numeric covariates

### Sampling strata

Numeric covariates are commonly used to optimize sample patterns to calibrate 
spatial trend models for DSM. Their use requires the definition of sampling
strata. Two types of sampling strata can be defined:

* Equal-area: the sampling strata are defined as to cover equally-sized areas
under the curve of the frequency distribution of the population of covariate
values. The sampling strata cover a smaller range of values at the regions 
where the frequency distribution is higher, and a larger range at the regions
where the frequency is lower. This guarantees that each sampling strata has the
same number of units. The method is also known as quantile sampling.

* Equal-range: The sampling strata are defined as to cover the same range of
values throughout the entire interval between the minimum and maximum value
without regard to the frequency distribution. The method is also know as uniform
sampling.

The method of M&M uses *equal-area* sampling strata so that the resulting sample 
can reproduce the marginal distribution of each covariate. The number of
sampling strata is set to the number of sample points $N$ so that the sample
can be marginally maximally stratified. In the Latin hypercube sampling, which 
is a stratified random sampling technique, the probability that a sample point
has of falling in each of the sampling strata is equal to $N^{-1}$
(PebesmaEtAl1999). In the method of M&M, these inclusion probabilities cannot 
be calculated because it is a non-probability purposive sampling technique.

The limits of each sampling strata are calculated using an estimate of the
sample quantiles of the covariate. The implementation in the R-package 
***clhs*** uses a continuous function to estimate the sample quantiles,
apparently because this is the default option in the function `quantile()`. But
because the covariates have a discontinuous nature, although being continuous 
variables, the sample quantiles cannot be estimated properly using a continuous
function. Otherwise the limits of the various sampling strata can assume values
that do not exist in the population of covariate values. The example bellow
shows that, although we can estimate five sampling strata for a covariate
composed of fifteen values, some of the break points do not exist in the 
population of covariate values, such as 2.6 and 4.4:

```{r}
n.pts <- 5
covars <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9))
probs <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n.pts + 1)
breaks <- lapply(covars, quantile, probs, na.rm = TRUE)
breaks
```

The current implementation of `optimACDC()` solves this problem using a
discontinuous function to calculate the sample quantiles - see *Definition 3* 
of HyndmanEtAl1996, which is implemented in the function `quantile()` setting
`type = 3`. This function was chosen among an universe of three functions
because it produced the best break points for a set of covariates with different
distributions, and it was the only one to produce the exact break points for a
uniformly distributed variable. For the example above, the quantiles now honour
the fact that the covariate is numeric but discontinuous:

```{r}
breaks <- lapply(covars, quantile, probs, na.rm = TRUE, type = 3)
breaks
```

The example shows that the *equal-area* method can yield duplicated break points
for the sampling strata. This is an inherent feature that comes from the concept
of sample quantiles. A break point will always be repeated if that value has a
relatively high frequency distribution in the population of covariate values.
This is what happens with the values 1 and 9. Note that this also is due to the
large number of sampling strata into which we want to split the covariate. The
problem disappears if we use a smaller number of sampling strata:

```{r}
n.pts <- 3
covars <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9))
probs <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n.pts + 1)
lapply(covars, quantile, probs, na.rm = TRUE, type = 3)
```

The conclusion is that we cannot define five sampling strata for our covariate.
But since we want to have five sample points and match the marginal distribution
of the covariate, the distribution of the number of points per strata will have
to be non-uniform. We count the number of points of the covariate that fall in
each of the new strata and divide it by the total number of points:

```{r}
n.pts <- 5
breaks <- unique(breaks[[1]])
breaks
n_cov <- ncol(covars)
count <- lapply(1:n_cov, function (i)
  hist(covars[, i], breaks, plot = FALSE)$counts)
count <- lapply(1:n_cov, function(i) count[[i]] / sum(count[[i]]) * n.pts)
count[[1]]
```

The *equal-range* method has the same limitations of the *equal-area* method
when the numeric covariate is discontinuous. The lower and upper limits of the
various sampling strata can assume values that do not exist in the population of
covariate values. It also can create sampling strata covering a range of values
that do not exist in the covariate. We see both problems bellow:

```{r}
n_cov <- ncol(covars)
breaks <- lapply(1:n_cov, function(i)
  seq(min(covars[, i]), max(covars[, i]), length.out = n.pts + 1))
breaks[[1]]
count <- lapply(1:n_cov, function (i)
  hist(covars[, i], breaks[[i]], plot = FALSE)$counts)
count[[1]]
```

The calculated break points are clearly inappropriate for our covariate. The
fourth strata covers a range of values that do not exist in the covariate. The
current version of `optimACDC()` solves this problem merging the empty sampling
strata with the closest non-empty sampling strata. Next we check for duplicated
break points using the same approach used with the *equal-area* method.
Duplicates are likely to appear when the number of sample points is large
relative to the number unique values in the covariate.

```{r}
require(SpatialTools)
d <- lapply(1:n_cov, function(i)
  SpatialTools::dist2(matrix(breaks[[i]]), matrix(covars[, i])))
d <- lapply(1:n_cov, function(i) apply(d[[i]], 1, which.min))
breaks <- lapply(1:n_cov, function(i) breaks[[i]] <- covars[d[[i]], i])
breaks <- lapply(breaks, unique)
breaks[[1]]
```

We use the same strategy used with the *equal-area* method to redistribute the
sample points among the sampling strata. The resulting distribution is
exactly proportional to the existing distribution of points per strata in the
population of covariate values. Non-integer values are commonly obtained:

```{r}
count <- lapply(1:n_cov, function (i)
  hist(covars[, i], breaks[[i]], plot = FALSE)$counts)
count <- lapply(1:n_cov, function(i)
  count[[i]] / sum(count[[i]]) * n.pts)
count[[1]]
```

The practical consequence of the modifications that we have implemented in
`optimACDC()` is that, given a set of covariates, each one of them will have a
different number of sampling strata. This will ultimately depend on the shape
of their frequency distribution, and on the relation between the number of
sample points and unique values in the covariate. In theoretical terms, this
means that the analogy of the method of M&M with the Latin square (or hypercube)
is incorrect. This is important because it emphasizes the fact that
`optimACDC()` (and the method of M&M) is a non-probability purposive sampling
method.

### Geographic coordinates

The geographic coordinates of the prediction grid can be used as numeric
covariates to optimize a sample pattern. This is useful if the geographic
coordinates are used as covariates to calibrate the trend model. This is done in
`optimACDC()` setting `use.coords = TRUE`. To use only the geographic 
coordinates as covariates, then they should be passed to `optimACDC()` using the
argument `covars`.

One must bear in mind that using the geographic coordinates as covariates is
not the same as optimizing a sample pattern by minimizing the mean squared
shortest distance (**MSSD**) between sample points and prediction points.
**ACDC** (and the method of M&M) is an optimizing criterion concerned solely
with the marginal distribution of the covariates, while **MSSD** looks at the
joint distribution of the geographic coordinates. The first aims at trend
estimation, the second at spatial interpolation. Using **ACDC** (and the method
of M&M) with the geographic coordinates to optimize a sample pattern for spatial
interpolation is sub-optimal because, placing all sample points in the diagonal
of the study area is accepted as an optimal solution.

We recommend that the geographic coordinates be used to optimize the sample
pattern if and only if they are to be used for trend estimation. This is useful
if there is an evident geographic trend in the data. `optimMSSD()` should be 
used to optimize a sample pattern for spatial interpolation.

## Factor covariates

The current version of `optimACDC()` does not handle numeric and factor
covariates simultaneously for the optimization. This can be seen as a weakness,
since the method of M&M, as implemented in the R-package ***clhs***, handles
both numeric and factor covariates simultaneously. We explain bellow the reasons
for the change.

### Association and correlation measures

Sampling for trend estimation is formulated here as a multi-objective 
optimization problem (MOOP). The method of M&M defined three objective 
functions. The first ($O_1$) was defined so that the sample would reproduce the 
marginal distribution of the numeric covariates. The second ($O_2$) was
concerned with the factor covariates. The goal was to obtain a sample that would
reproduce the class proportions. The third ($O_3$) was defined to guarantee that
the linear structure present in the population would be reproduced in the 
sample. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was used as a measure of this
linear structure.

Two of the objective functions ($O_1$ and $O_3$) were designed to guarantee that
the sample would reproduce the features of the numeric covariates. This means
that the method inherently gives a larger weight to the numeric covariates. One
could view this feature as a positive one, claiming that the numeric
covariates have more information than the factor covariates. We disagree with
this view because *information content* is not necessarily related with
*explanatory power*: the factor covariates might be better predictors than the
numeric ones. As such, we understand that this feature is a bias towards the
numeric covariates. This bias cannot be corrected by simply choosing the proper
weights because the behaviour of each of the objective functions is largely
unknown.

One alternative is to use a measure of association among factor covariates as
the linear correlation is used for the numeric covariates. The Cramér's $v$ can
be used for this purpose. The Cramér's $v$ is a measure of association between
factor covariates that ranges from 0 to 1: the closer to 1, the larger the
association between two factor covariates. The Cramér's $v$ is given by (Cramér,
1946):

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^{2} / n}{min(c - 1, r - 1)}}
$$

where $r$ and $c$ are the number of rows and columns of the contingency table,
$n$ is the number of observations, and $\chi^{2}$ is the chi-squared statistic 
(Everitt, 2006):

$$
\chi^{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{r} \sum_{j = 1}^{c} (O_i - E_i)^2 / E_i
$$

where $O_i$ and $E_i$ are the observed and expected frequency, respectively.

We do not have a solution to measure the association/correlation among the
numeric and factor covariates. As such, if the set of covariates has any factor
covariate, we choose to transform any numeric covariate into a factor covariate, 
and use the Cramér's $v$ as a measure of association. The numeric covariates are
categorized using the sampling strata defined using one of the methods described 
above (equal-area or equal-range). If all covariates are numeric, then we use
the standard Pearson's correlation coefficient. This is not without losses. 
While the Pearson's correlation coefficient shows the degree and direction of
the association between two covariates (negative or positive), the Cramér's *v*
only measures the degree (weak or strong).

# Objective functions

We have implemented the method of M&M in `optimACDC()` with a few modifications 
to correct its weaknesses. We saw that the number of sampling strata cannot be
equal to the number of sample points. The bias towards numeric covariates was
corrected transforming them to factor covariates when both types of covariates
are available. The association measure used in this case is the Cramér's $v$. 
Finally, we chose to name the *new* method based solely on the objective 
functions that are compose it: an association/correlation measure and the 
marginal distribution of the covariates, **ACDC**.

The method of M&M was composed by the weighted sum of three objective functions.
**ACDC**, instead, is composed by the weighted sum of only two objective
functions. The first uses a measure of association ($f_{1\text{ factor}}$) or
correlation ($f_{1\text{ numeric}}$), while the second is concerned with the
marginal distribution ($f_{2\text{ numeric}}$ or $f_{2\text{ factor}}$) of the
covariates, depending whether they are of type numeric or factor.

The first objective function is defined for numeric covariates as follows:

$$
f_{1\text{ numeric}} = || \mathbf{P} - \mathbf{R} ||_{p = \infty}
                     = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \sum_{j = 1}^{k} |\rho_{ij} - r_{ij}|
$$

where $\rho_{ij}$ and $r_{ij}$ are the population and sample linear correlations
at the $i\text{th}$ row and $j\text{th}$ column of the $k\text{-dimensional}$ 
population and sample linear correlation matrices $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{R}$,
$k$ being the number of covariates. For factor covariates, the first objective
function is defined as follows:

$$
f_{1\text{ factor}} = || \Phi - \mathbf{V} ||_{p = \infty}
                    = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \sum_{j = 1}^{k} |\phi_{ij} - v_{ij}|
$$

where $\phi_{ij}$ and $v_{ij}$ are the population and sample associations
at the $i\text{th}$ row and $j\text{th}$ column of the $k\text{-dimensional}$
population and sample association matrices $\Phi$ and $\mathbf{V}$. The goal of
the first objective function is to minimize the max norm (element-wise norm with 
$p = \infty$) of the difference between the matrices of population and sample
association/correlation measures.

The goal of the second objective function is to minimize the sum of the sum-norm
(or 1-norm) of the difference between the covariate-wise vectors of population
and sample marginal distributions. It is defined as follows for numeric 
covariates:

$$
f_{2\text{ numeric}} = || \mathbf{\eta} - \mathbf{\psi}  ||_{1}
                     = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \sum_{j = 1}^{s_i}
                      \left|\eta_{ij} - \psi_{ij} \right|
$$

where $\eta_{ij}$ and $\psi_{ij}$ are the proportion (in percentage) of sample
and population points that fall in the *j*th sampling strata of the *i*th
covariate, $s$ being the number of sampling strata of the *i*th covariate.
$\mathbf{\eta}$ and $\mathbf{\psi}$ are the population and sample vectors of 
sum-norms. For factor covariates, the second objective function is defined as
follows:

$$
f_{2\text{ factor}} = || \mathbf{\pi} - \mathbf{\gamma} ||_{1}
                    = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \sum_{j = 1}^{c_i}
                      \left|\pi_{ij} - \gamma_{ij} \right|
$$

where $\pi_{ij}$ and $\gamma_{ij}$ are the proportion (in percentage) of sample
and population points that fall in the *j*th class of the *i*th covariate, $c$
being the number of classes of the *i*th covariate. $\mathbf{\pi}$ and 
$\mathbf{\gamma}$ are the population and sample vectors of sum-norms. Note that
we work with the vector of the marginal distribution of each covariate 
separately because the number of sampling strata (numeric) or classes (factor)
can be different for each covariate. Because this results in a non-uniform
distribution of points per sampling strata and class, we use the proportion of
points per sampling strata, instead of the number of points, as a measure of 
coverage of the marginal distribution of the numeric covariates. The values are 
multiplied by 100 for numerical stability.

We did not make any test yet to check if there is any negative consequence
deriving from our choices. If any, they might become less important as the
number of sample points increases. Besides, we understand that correcting the
bias towards the numeric covariates is a fundamental step to built a more robust
sampling method.

## Utopia and nadir points

In theory, the utopia ($\mathbf{f}^{\circ}$) and nadir 
($\mathbf{f}^{\text{max}}$) points of **ACDC** can be calculated exactly. This
is only partially true. We can calculate exactly the minimum and maximum
absolute values of the first objective function that composes **ACDC**, which
uses a measure of association/correlation among the covariates. For both numeric
and factor covariates, the utopia point is exactly

$$
\begin{align*}
 f^{\circ}_{1\text{ numeric}} & = 0 \\
 f^{\circ}_{1\text{ factor}}  & = 0
\end{align*}
$$

which means that the population association/correlation matrix is equal to the
sample association/correlation matrix. The nadir point is

$$
\begin{align*} 
 f^{\text{max}}_{1\text{ numeric}} & = 
    2k + || \mathbf{P} - \mathbf{I} ||_{p = \infty} \\
 f^{\text{max}}_{1\text{ factor}}  & = 
    2k - || \mathbf{\Phi} - \mathbf{I} ||_{p = \infty}
\end{align*} 
$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, and $2k$ is the number of non-zero 
(nnz) entries in $\mathbf{\Delta}$, the matrix of the differences between the
population and sample matrix of association/correlation measures. 
$f^{\text{max}}_{1\text{ factor}}$ subtracts the right-hand term from the 
left-hand term to account for the fact that the Cramér's $v$ ranges from 0 to
+1, while the Pearson's $r$ ranges from -1 to +1.

The utopia point of the second objective function is exactly

$$
\begin{align*}
 f^{\circ}_{2\text{ numeric}} & = 0 \\
 f^{\circ}_{2\text{ factor}}  & = 0
\end{align*}
$$

which means that the sample reproduces exactly the marginal distribution of the
covariates. The nadir point can only be calculated when the number of covariates
is equal to one, which is useless because `optimACDC()` requires at least two
covariates. For a single covariate, the nadir point is:

$$
\begin{align*}
 f^{\text{max}}_{2\text{ numeric}} & = 2 \times (100 - min(\mathbf{\eta})) \\
 f^{\text{max}}_{2\text{ factor}}  & = 2 \times (100 - min(\mathbf{\pi}))
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{\eta}$ and $\mathbf{\pi}$ are the vectors of the marginal 
distribution of the covariate expressed in terms of proportion (in percentage) 
of population points per sampling strata and class, respectively. The equations
above indicate that the worst case scenario is to place all sample points in the
sampling strata or class in which we expect to have the smallest number of
sample points. If we were working with a true Latin hypercube we would be able 
to extend the equations to all covariates and calculate the exact value of the 
nadir point. But because we are ignorant about all possible combinations of 
values among covariates, specially because many of combinations are impossible
due to the constrained nature of the data, an estimate of the nadir point would 
be highly uncertain. The alternative is to estimate the nadir point using expert 
knowledge or simulations, or use the Pareto maximum.
